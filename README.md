## Project Title
Rhyme Finder
## Description
I built this webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to practise HTTP requests using the async...await syntax. It retrieves data from the Datamuse API. The user types in a word and a number, and a list is displayed showing that number of rhymes for the word they input. If they try to press the button without entering a word or number, or if the number is out of range, there is an alert.
## Areas for future improvement
- Currently this uses a button HTML element that is separate to the form element, rather than an `<input type="submit">`. When I tried using that for the submit button, the list of words flashed on the screen but did not stay. I found that I could get the functionality I wanted by using a `<button>` instead, though I am not sure if this is best practice. This is something I would like to come back to in the future if needed.
- I would like the results to display in columns if there are more than 10 results so it is possible to view the whole list without needing to scroll down. 
## How to use
